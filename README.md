# Remote Work Health Impact Analysis (2025)

This project analyzes the impact of remote work on employee well-being using a fictional survey dataset for the year 2025. The objective is to uncover insights about burnout, mental health, work-life balance, and physical health issues across different demographics, job roles, industries, and work arrangements (Remote, Hybrid, Onsite).

**üìä Project Highlights:**

Data Cleaning & Exploration: SQL queries to check for null values, unique records, and overall data structure.
